<h1>How to make Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
<p>This is by far the best recipe I have found to make the perfect Chocolate Chip Cookie</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Butter:</strong> The staple to making a good cookie is good butter</li>
    <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Unfortunately if you aren't able to eat eggs you can't eat perfection</li>
    <li><strong>Vailla:</strong> The best way to add that extra flavour</li>
    <li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong> Nobody wants a flat, lifeless cookie, this will add that fluffy look</li>
    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Similar to the baking soda this will give it some fluff</li>
    <li><strong>Salt:</strong> No this won't make the cookie have a salty taste</li>
    <li><strong>Flour:</strong> Did you think you can make a cookie without this? You were right but we are using it anyway</li>
    <li><strong>Chocolate Chips:</strong> The "Chocolate Chip" part of the cookie</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step by Step Baking Process</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Beat the Butter and Sugars, then beat in the Eggs and Vanilla into one bowl</li>
    <li>Dissolve the Baking Soda in hot Water and add to the mixture</li>
    <li>Stir in the Flour, Chocolate Chips</li>
    <li>Drop the dough onto a baking sheet</li>
    <li>Bake until the edges are golden brown</li>
</ol>
